If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn,
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me baby, beause I'm moanin' low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold
All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man.
Last fair deal in the country, Sweet Suzie,
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby,
Before you let my deal go down
Don't you push me baby, cause I'm moanin' low
And I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gotta get up in the morning and go
Everybody's braggin and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight,
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I no chance of losing this time...
Last fair deal in the country,
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is baby,
Before you let my deal go down
Everybody's braggin and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight,
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time
Well I got no chance of losing this time...
